# Hotelytics AI

Welcome to my **hotelytics.ai** project! This repository contains all the necessary components to scrape, analyze, predict and summarise sentiments from hotel reviews.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Our project focuses on predicting **positive & negative sentiments** from hotel reviews using a combination of advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classical Machine Learning models. We aim to provide a robust solution that can assist hotels in understanding guest satisfaction through automated sentiment analysis.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **Artifacts**:  
  - `NPN_Logistic_Regression_Model.pkl`: Logistic Regression model for comparison.
  - `NPN_Label_Encoder.pkl`: Pre-trained label encoder for categorical variables.
  - `NPN_TF_IDF_Vectorizer.pkl`: TF-IDF vectorizer to transform text data.

- **notebooks**:  
  - `Hotel_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook detailing the model training and evaluation.

- **src**:  
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization for the source module.
  - `prediction.py`: Contains functions for making sentiment predictions.
  - `summariser.py`: Script for summarizing reviews and key sentiments.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the project.

- **templates**:  
  - `img/`: Images and media files used in the project.

- **Web_Scraping**:  
  - `scraper.py`: The web scraping script to extract reviews from online sources.
  - `test.py`: Testing scripts to validate the scraper's performance.

- `.gitignore`: Files and folders to be ignored by Git.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages required to run the project.
- `.streamlit/`: Streamlit configuration files for deploying the web app.
- `hotelytics.py`: The main Streamlit application file that launches the web interface for the project, allowing users to interact with the sentiment analysis model and visualize the results.
- `setup.py`: Setup script for easy installation of the project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mainak-Das/hotelytics.ai.git
cd hotelytics.ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. **Scrape Data**: Use the web scraper to collect hotel reviews.
   ```bash
   python Web_Scraping/test.py
   ```

2. **Run Analysis**: Execute the Jupyter notebook to train models and analyze sentiments.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Hotel_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. **Deploy the App**: Deploy the Streamlit web app to showcase your results.
   ```bash
   streamlit run hotelytics.py
   ```

## üß† Model Overview

- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model for comparison.

## üìà Results

Our models have been fine-tuned and evaluated to achieve high accuracy in predicting sentiment from hotel reviews. Detailed results can be found in the notebook.
